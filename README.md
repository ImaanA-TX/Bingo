# Bingo


This program, when ran as is, will create 10 bingo sheet with numbers rangeing from 1 to 75. The sheets will be stored in a PDF titled 'Bingo_file.pdf'. It could easily be changed to have a different range and number of sheets.

You may get a runtime error if you try 20+ bingo sheets in a single pdf.
